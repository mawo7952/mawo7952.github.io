### Introduction
Hi, I’m Matthew Woodland, a graduate student in the Geography Department at the University of Colorado Boulder. My academic background is in GIS, remote sensing, and Earth/atmospheric sciences. My current work builds on these foundations through the lens of public health.

I research indoor air quality and its impacts on pediatric health, using low-cost air pollution monitors to study PM<sub>2.5</sub> in elementary schools and students’ homes across the Denver Metro region.

Feel free to explore my professional background and connect with me below.
